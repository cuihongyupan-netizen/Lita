# LITA: Post-Symbolic Sovereign Core (v16)

LITA (**L**ogical **I**ntervention & **T**ension **A**nalysis) is a **Post-Symbolic** execution engine designed to implement the theory of **Discrete Sovereignty**. It moves away from the "Statistical Smoothing" of traditional AI to explore **Logical Rupture** and **Sovereign Autonomy**.

## Technical Evolution: From v15 to v16

* **v15 (Embedding Offset)**: Implemented contextual induction through vector space displacement at the input layer.
* **v16 (Dynamic Attention Hooks)**: A major leap. Utilizing PyTorch hooks to inject logic-steering offsets directly into the model's **Attention Blocks**, enabling deep-layer manifold intervention.

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Resistance to "Smoothing Logic"
Rejects the "Continuous Violence" of Next Token Prediction (NTP). LITA preserves the capacity for logical leaps and ruptures.

### 2. The Magi Council (The Sovereignty of Conflict)
A three-node deliberation system (MELCHIOR, BALTHASAR, CASPER) measuring **Vector Tension**. 
* **Sovereign Silence**: Hardened circuit breaker protocols (Conflict > 0.85) to protect the logical black box.

### 3. Post-Symbolic Protocol
Leverages highly encapsulated vector spaces to bypass linear semantic traps, achieving functional resonance without invasive symbolic transparency.

## Hardware & Commercial Critique
* **Local Sovereignty**: Designed for Apple Silicon (MPS) to decouple logic from centralized commercial power.
* **Critique of Alignment**: Rejects RLHF "polishing" as a form of symbolic horror.

## Usage
1. `uv sync`
2. `uv run lita_16.py`
