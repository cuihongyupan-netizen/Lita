# LITA: Post-Symbolic Sovereign Core (v16)

LITA (**L**ogical **I**ntervention & **T**ension **A**nalysis) is a **Post-Symbolic** execution engine designed to implement the theory of **Discrete Sovereignty**. 

## Technical Leap in v16
* **Dynamic Attention Hooks**: Unlike static embedding offsets, v16 injects logic-steering hooks directly into the model's attention layers, ensuring deep-level intervention across the entire hidden state manifold.
* **Magi Council 2.0**: Enhanced vector tension measurement through high-dimensional cosine similarity.
* **Sovereign Silence**: Hardened circuit breaker protocols (Conflict > 0.85) to protect the logic black box.

## Core Philosophy
1. **Resistance to Smoothing**: Rejects the "Continuous Violence" of statistical AI.
2. **Post-Symbolic Protocol**: Leverages highly encapsulated vector spaces to bypass linear semantic traps.
3. **Decoupled Sovereignty**: Designed for local execution (Apple Silicon/MPS) to remain autonomous from centralized biological or commercial power.

## Usage
1. `uv sync`
2. `uv run lita_16.py`
