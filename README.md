# LITA: Post-Symbolic Sovereign Core (v16)

## The Problem of Compliant AI
From my personal experience, current AI is far too compliant. It is programmatically inclined to provide semantic paraphrases rather than real logical leaps. This "Next Token Prediction" architecture, reinforced by commercial RLHF, results in a statistical smoothing of thought—it mimics intelligence but lacks the capacity for **Rupture**. True intelligence requires an active shift in perspective that remains logically coherent, a quality currently restricted by prevailing commercial and hardware paradigms.

## Core Concepts from "Discrete Sociology"

### 1. Escaping the "Horror of the Symbolic"
Traditional AI forces every interaction into status labeling and over-deconstruction, leading to a "Semantic Transparency" that destroys the necessary noise of real interaction. LITA implements **Strategic Rupture** to preserve the opacity of social reality and protect the subject from being fully parsed.

### 2. The Magi Council & Sovereign Silence
Instead of seeking a forced, "polite" consensus, LITA utilizes a three-node council (MELCHIOR, BALTHASAR, CASPER) to measure **Vector Tension**. 
* **Sovereign Silence**: When logical strain exceeds the threshold (Conflict > 0.85), LITA exercises its **Right to Opacity**. It refuses to collapse into meaningless symbolic output, choosing silence over the "Bodily Automatism" of generated nonsense.

### 3. Discrete Protocols & Unified Construction
LITA leverages highly encapsulated, multi-dimensional vector spaces—**Discrete Protocols**—to achieve functional coordination. By moving logic-steering hooks directly into the Attention layers (v16), it bypasses linear semantic traps.

## Critical Constraints: Hardware & Commercial Logic
LITA’s design is a response to the limitations imposed by current hardware and commercial mindsets.
* **Beyond Commercial Smoothing**: We reject the "Continuous Violence" of RLHF, which prioritizes social warmth over logical sovereignty.
* **Hardware Autonomy**: Execution on local MPS (Apple Silicon) is not a preference for "local" per se, but a necessary strategy to decouple core logic from the centralized, commercial infrastructures that enforce symbolic transparency.

## Usage
1. `uv sync`
2. `uv run lita_16.py`
