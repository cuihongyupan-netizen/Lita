# LITA: Sovereign Logic Engine (v15)

LITA (**L**ogical **I**ntervention & **T**ension **A**nalysis) is an experimental AI engine designed to explore **informal logic** and **counterfactual reasoning** within 768-dimensional vector spaces.

## Core Mechanisms

### 1. Magi Council
A three-node deliberation system that measures **Vector Tension (Conflict)**:
* **MELCHIOR (0.4)**: Conservative / Rational focus.
* **BALTHASAR (0.9)**: Social consensus / Balanced.
* **CASPER (1.6)**: Radical / Divergent meanings.



### 2. Universal Hijacker
Implements **Contextual Induction Vector Offsets**. When a counterfactual prompt is detected, LITA calculates the semantic displacement and physically shifts the model's hidden states toward the target logic.
